Hello, I work as a programmer, illustrator, community manager and occasional public speaker. I currently reside within New England, in the United States.

I have self-taught myself a myriad of skills pertaining to computers and computer technology as far back as my family has owned computers. In my spare time, I enjoy puzzles, movies, and video-games; Either playing them, or modding them in some way. My passion is for making things, and I am always quite motivated.
