# Hi! I'm Rowdy! (´･ω･`)

*Founder / Head Administrator at [Southern Cross Gaming](https://www.scg.wtf)*

Hello, I work as a programmer, illustrator, community manager and occasional public speaker. I currently reside within New England, in the United States.

I have self-taught myself a myriad of skills pertaining to computers and computer technology as far back as 1998, when my family got our first computer. In my spare time, I enjoy puzzles, movies, and video-games; Either playing them, or modding them in some way. My passion is for making things and bringing people together! I believe the internet is one of the greatest tools we have today, and despite its flaws, it can be used to bring people together who otherwise may never have felt valid.

## Skills
I have experience with many languages and tools ranging from web design to general programming. This includes but is not limited to **Html and other related web design thgngs, Javascript / Node, PHP, C++, C#, SourcePawn, Lua, Java, JQuery** and more. I'm a quiet Linux nerd, I use Ubunutu on my web server and Debian for my game server. I generally avoid using frameworks when I can help it, I am annoying and like to make things by hand.
