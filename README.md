# Hi! I'm Rowdy! (Â´ï½¥Ï‰ï½¥`)

*Founder / Head Administrator at [Southern Cross Gaming](https://www.scg.wtf)*

Hello, I work as a programmer, illustrator, community manager and occasional public speaker. I currently reside within New England, in the United States.

I have self-taught myself a myriad of skills pertaining to computers and computer technology starting as early as 2005. In my spare time, I often find myself immersed in video games. Either playing them, or modding them in some way. My passion is community and I have a special focus on communities within the internet. I strongly believe that well-maintained online social spaces for those of similar interests are an important tool for humanity.

## Current focus

My current side-project is a daily planner built around proven motivational and efficiency concepts designed to prevent overwhelming the person using it. Right now, it is for personal use but if I can demonstrate a measurable improvement in my ability to get tasks done in a timely manner, I will see what I can do in terms of allowing others to use it.
