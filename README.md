# Hi! I'm Rowdy! (Â´ï½¥Ï‰ï½¥`)

*Founder / Head Administrator at [Southern Cross Gaming](https://www.scg.wtf)*

Hello, I work as a programmer, illustrator, community manager and occasional public speaker. I currently reside within New England, in the United States.

I have self-taught myself a myriad of skills pertaining to computers and computer technology starting as early as 2005. In my spare time, I often find myself immersed in video games. Either playing them, or modding them in some way. My passion is community and I have a special focus on communities within the internet. I strongly believe that well-maintained online social spaces for those of similar interests are an important tool for humanity.

## Skills
I have experience with many languages and tools ranging from web design to general programming. This includes but is not limited to **Html, Css, Javascript / Node, C++, C#, Java, JQuery, Bootstrap, Tailwind** and more. I also have ample experience with Linux as I use Ubuntu and Debian to host my web and game servers respectively.
